<h1> About This Site </h1>
<p>
This site was created to show the content creation process for the "DjYale" brand. Each video takes hundreds of hours to create, and have tons of complex/moving parts, so this website should hopefully spotlight some parts of the video creation journey, and explain them with visual compliments.
</p>
<h2>Tools Used
</h2>
<p>
This website was created by using HTML, designing CSS stylesheets, implementing JavaScript Scripts, using version control through GitHub, and hosted with Netlify.
</p>
<h2>
Why?
</h2>
<p>
This site was created as an assignment for Client Side Web Development class, for future repurposing as several different sites. It was deigned with the intention of being split up later, into more helpful sections for designing a portfolio and merch site for my brand.
