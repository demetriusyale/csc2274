<h1> Photoshop</h1>
<p>
Photoshop has accidentally become a large part of my video creation journey. I find myself needing to edit images almost all the time now, whether I need to remove backgrounds, change colors, make a thumbnail, resize small assets, or even recreate game assets. Photoshop quickly turned into a non-negotiable part of my workflow, and helps in ways I'm sure I'm not even remembering right now.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail Work</h2>

<p>One of, if not, the MOST important part of a video's success, is how it's packaged. I use photoshop to create visually enticing and appealing images to get people to click on my videos. I try to keep a simplistic style, in an attempt to appeal to as wide of an audience as possible, but even these simple edits get complex pretty quickly. Stacking layers of characters, backgrounds, text and other visual elements lets me composition thumbnails, and even after that much work, I end up having to make ton of new designs for each video, as I test different ones against each other. Little differences such as text placement or color grading can have a substantial impact on how often a thumbnail gets clicked, so I need to keep the projects organized enough to constantly work on them, making little tweaks to test against each other. (parts of a thumbnail before being put together, and the photoshop process of putting it all together. 7DTD video should be a good one for teaching it.)</p>
<p>The following steps show how I created the best performing thumbnail for one of my more recent videos. There were others that were more complex, but this one appealed to viewers the most.</p>
<section class="flex-demo">
<div class="card2">
<img src="/thumbpics/1.jpg" width=100%>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>This thumbnail starts with getting a high resolution image from in-game. This specific image is a close-up of the characters face, which we'll use to convey a struggle, and create recognizability from those who have played the game before.</p>


</div>

<div class="card2">
<img src="/thumbpics/2.png" width=100%>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Cut out the player from the image.</p>

</div>

<div class="card2">
<img src="/thumbpics/3.png" width=100%>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Find a more active ingame shot to use as background, apply blur to only focus on an interesting part and take down excessive noise.</p>

</div>

<div class="card2">
<img src="/thumbpics/4.png" width=100%>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Place player character into our new shot, with face edited to look like one eye is closed. This will later turn into a black eye, but gives us a swollen look for now.</p>

</div>

<div class="card2">
<img src="/thumbpics/5.png" width=100%>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Add a strong black glow under player to seperate from background</p>

</div>
<div class="card2">
<img src="/thumbpics/6.png" width=100%>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Paint in color for black eye and cut on face to convey a harder struggle, and add captivating text that hooks viewers with how long a video took to complete.</p>

</div>


</section>

<h2>
Visualizing Jokes
</h2>
<p>
Basic Photoshop editing has let me make jokes I want shown in a video come alive, as even a quick rush job can greatly help making a section more visually appealing and enjoyable to watch, like in this example image, where in the video I was talking about how hopeless I felt in the game, and visualized it with my character appearing as an emo teenager from the 2000's.(image of the before and after of 7DTD character going emo) </p>


<h2>Asset Design</h2>
<p>Creating videos that take hundreds of hours to make, you end up needing a lot of assets to either break up monotony in a video, or contribute to visual continuity. For example, I needed a background to put assets on top of for a video, so instead of having a flat color, I decided to use one of the textures from the game I was playing in the video. This texture wouldn't work as a background by itself, so I took the texture, repeated it many times in a large grid, then added a vignette and motion to it in a Premiere Pro. This allowed me to go from just a single texture, to a background that both ties into the game that the video is about, and helps to keep things interesting while explaining long worded sections. </p>
