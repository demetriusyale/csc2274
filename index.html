        This website contains a portfolio for Demetrius Yale (DjYale), a merch store layout for future use, and contact
        pages for clients to get in touch with Demetrius Yale.

      <p>
        The information on this site will talk about the process that I go through to make videos, what tools I use to
        get the job done, and why I choose to use certain techniques in my work, as well as displaying some of the
        finished results of my work.

    <h1> Website Sections </h1>
    <h2>Section 1: Info</h2>
    <p>The first section of the website (Home, Contact, and About this site) are informative pages about who I am, why
      this site was created, and how to get into contact with me. These will be where people come to find out how the
      site works, why it exists, and how to navigate it correctly.</p>
    <h2>Section 2: Merch Store</h2>
    <p>Section two includes the merch store, a spot for me to set up a the general layout of a merch store for my
      brands.</p>
    <h2>Section 3: Portfolio</h2>
    <p>Section three is the portfolio section, housing my editing portfolio and image editing portfolio. These are the
      two main skills I use when creating content online, so they will have the bulk of information and content. </p>
    <h2>Section 4: Accolades</h2>
    <p>Finally, section four includes only an accolades page, which will be a section that is disguised as a positive
      section with kind words about the content I've made online, but instead will hold the funniest annry comments I've
      recieved. You can't please everybody on the internet, and when people get angry about you playing video games,
      they tend to accidentally be very funny.
    </p>

    <h1>What I Make</h1>
    <p>I create long form gaming videos detailing the journey of me taking on specific very difficult challenges, and
      documenting everything I have to do to complete that challenge. I do things in games that most people can't,
      leveraging my unhealthy addiction to screens to spend hundreds of hours in a video game for each video. This lets
      me curate which parts of the challenge I want to show to make the most entertaining video possible, while showing
      people what the journey is like, since many cant spend as much time playing a game as I will.</p>
    <p>Choosing these long challenges let's me spend time getting to know the game, and it's community. Many videos
      about games online only attempt to be surface level glances of what a game offers, while mine tend to show more
      intricate parts of the game, since I spend so much more time on them than other creators.</p>
    <p>This may lead to less video output overall for me, but helps me feel some pride in the fact that I was able to
      accomplish something that most people won't, even if it's almost entirely because nobody should spend that much
      time playing a game.</p>
