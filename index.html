<h1> What is this site? </h1>
 <img src="DJPog-Flat.png">
<p>  
This website contains a portfolio for Demetrius Yale (DjYale), a merch store layout for future use, and contact pages for clients to get in touch with Demetrius Yale.
</p>

<p>
    The information on this site will talk about the process that I go through to make videos, what tools I use to get the job done, and why I choose to use certain techniques in my work, as well as displaying some of the finished results of my work.
</p>
<h1> Website Sections </h1>
<h2>Section 1: Info</h2>
<p>The first section of the website (Home, Contact, and About this site) are informative pages about who I am, why this site was created, and how to get into contact with me. These will be where people come to find out how the site works, why it exists, and how to navigate it correctly.</p>
<h2>Section 2: Merch Store</h2>
<p>Section two includes the merch store, a spot for me to set up a the general layout of a merch store for my brands.</p>
<h2>Section 3: Portfolio</h2>
<p>Section three is the portfolio section, housing my editing portfolio and image editing portfolio. These are the two main skills I use when creating content online, so they will have the bulk of information and content. </p>
<h2>Section 4: Accolades</h2>
<p>Finally, section four includes only an accolades page, which will be a section that is disguised as a positive section with kind words about the content I've made online, but instead will hold the funniest annry comments I've recieved. You can't please everybody on the internet, and when people get angry about you playing video games, they tend to accidentally be very funny.
