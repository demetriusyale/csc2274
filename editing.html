<h1> Editing </h1>
<p>
Nearly all editing on my social media pages are done using the Adobe Suite, more specifically, Adobe Premiere Pro. I like to make most simple animations using work-around methods in Premiere, even though software like After Effects might be better suited. I tend to avoid using AE as much as possible, as it's a lot more complicated which leads to segments taking much longer to edit, but the results are usually more advanced, and cleaner.</p>

<h2>Rotoscoping</h2>
<p>
One of the main types of edits I do use After Effects for, is the Rotoscoping feature. This allows me to "cut-out" parts of a video, and make the rest of it transparent. It's especially useful for adding segments of meme videos or recogonizable bits/jokes into my video in a clean way that blends well. I tend to style the rotoscoped video further, adding effects such as drop shadows and playing with the edges to make them blend even better. 
</p>

<h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
<p>
  Mainly done in Premiere, a lot of my motion graphics are made to make the viewing experience easier on the eyes, and to help explain certain topics while keeping the flow of the video moving smoothly. These bits also help add visual stimulus, increasing retention on my videos. 
</p>

<h2>Physics Simulation</h2>
<p>
  Another use I get out of After Effects, is using the horribly expensive "Newton" plugin. This is a powerful plugin that allows me to simulate physics/gravity with whatever compostitions I put together. Since I've downloaded it, I've used it for many different applications, like making what would normally be insanely complex motion graphics when made manually, and helping to visualize otherwise boring segments of videos.
  (Include bouncing machines video, skeletron being decimated, and items falling.)
